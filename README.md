# agsXMPP.NetCore

An fork to add .NET6.0+ support to classic XMPP library agsXMPP from AG-Software. [Github / agsXMPP](https://github.com/agnauck/agsXMPP)

### Security Notes

- This fork contains the original code, with some adjustments for .NET6.

- It will not have any absurd changes or future patches of new features.

- For production ready i **strongly** recommend using the successors of agsXMPP such as [Matrix](https://www.ag-software.net/matrix-xmpp-sdk/) and [XmppDotNet](https://xmppdotnet.org/) in addition to being actively developed, it is also more secure and stable.


You can find this releases on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/agsXMPP.NetCore/).
